        Roles: Decider or Receiver
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        In this experiment, there are two possible roles: Decider or Receiver.
            </li>
        <li>
        Your role will be determined randomly at the beginning of the experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
        You will keep this same role for the entire experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
        You will learn your role before making any decisions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Rounds & Matching:
    </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        There will be <strong> {{ Constants.number_rounds }} rounds </strong> in this experiment.
    </li>
    <li>
        In every round, each Decider will be matched with a new Receiver.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will never be matched with the same player for more than a single round over the course of the experiment.
    </li>
</ul>

    <p>
    The Decider's Choice:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        In each of the {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds, the Receiver is given an endowment of <strong>{{ Constants.endowment }}</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Decider will then have the opportunity to <strong>take</strong> any part of the Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }}
        endowment.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Receiver's earnings:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        After the Decider chooses how much to take from the Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }} endowment, the Receiver is left with whatever remains.
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
            So if the Decider chooses to take $X of the Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }}, then in that round the Decider gets $X while the Receiver gets {{ Constants.endowment }} - $X.
            </li>
            </ul>
</ul>
