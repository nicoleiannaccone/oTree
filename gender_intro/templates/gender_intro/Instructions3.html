<u> Screennames </u>
<ul>
        <li>
        Deciders will be assigned screennames.
        </li>
        <li>
            These screennames may assist Receivers in rating and responding to their Decider's allocation decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Receivers are fully anonymous -- they do not receive screennames, and are
        encouraged to write and rate freely when evaluating their Deciders' allocation decisions.
        </li>
</ul>
{% else %}
All players are anonymous - you will never be identified to other players in the session.
