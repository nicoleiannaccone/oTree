                In this experiment, there are two possible roles: Decider and Receiver.
                Your role will be randomly determined at the beginning of the experiment.
                You will learn your role before making any decisions, and you will keep this same role
                for the entire experiment.
            <p>
                There will be 5 rounds in this experiment.
                In every round, each Decider will be matched with a new Receiver. No player will ever be
                matched with the same player for more than a single round over the course of the experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In each of the 5 rounds, an endowment of <strong> {{ Constants.endowment }} </strong>
                will be given to the <strong>Receiver</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Decider will then be given the opportunity to take any part of the Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }}
                endowment, in increments of $1.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Receiver will receive whatever the Decider chooses not to take.
                For example, if the Decider chooses to take $X of the Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }}, then $X is added to the
                Decider's final earnings while {{ Constants.endowment }} - $X is added to the Receiver's earnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deciders will be assigned screennames which may assist Receivers in rating and responding to each of their
                matched Decider's allocation decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Receivers are fully anonymous -- they do not receive screennames, and are
                encouraged to write and rate freely when evaluating their Deciders' allocation decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Deciders are choosing how much to take,
                Receivers will be told their matched Decider's assigned screenname and asked to evaluate the different possible
                choices available to the Decider.
            </p>
            <p>
                They must decide, for each of the possible amounts the Decider could take, whether taking that amount
                would be considered "socially appropriate" and "consistent with moral or proper social behavior" or "socially inappropriate" and
                "inconsistent with moral or proper social behavior."
            </p>
            <p>
                By socially appropriate, we mean behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to think about what we mean is that if an individual were to select a socially inappropriate choice,
                then someone else might be angry at that individual for doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Receivers do not observe the Decider's chosen allocation until after they have rated the appropriateness of each possible
                allocation decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Receivers earn an additional monetary prize if their rating turns out to match the most common rating given to that
                particular allocation by all other Receivers who were matched with a Decider with that screenname.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Deciders have chosen how much to take from their Receiver's {{ Constants.endowment }} and Receivers have
                finished rating each possible allocation, the Decider's chosen allocation decision will be shown to the Receiver.
                Receivers will then write a message that the Decider will see at the end of the experiment.
            </p>
