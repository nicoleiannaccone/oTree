<u> Order of Each Round: </u>
<ol>
    <li>
        In each round, while the Decider is choosing how much of the Receiver's
        {{ Constants.endowment }} endowment to take, the Receiver will be evaluating the
        appropriateness of the different possible choices available to the Decider.    </li>
    <li> Before seeing their Decider's choice, Receivers will rate the social appropriateness of each
        potential choice their Decider could make.   </li>
    <li>    After the Decider makes their choice, this choice will be shown to the Receiver.    </li>
    <li>    The Receiver will then write their Decider a message responding to the Decider's choice. </li>
    <li>    Deciders will see these messages at the end of the experiment after they have finished making all their choices. </li>
</ol>
