    The table below presents a list of the possible choices that were available to Deciders.

    For each of the choices below, you should indicate how appropriate you think <strong> Receivers </strong> rated
    each choice to be when chosen by a Decider with the screenname <strong> Anthony </strong>.

    That is, indicate whether you think that Receivers said that a Decider "Anthony" choosing
    that option would be very socially inappropriate, somewhat socially inappropriate, somewhat socially appropriate,
    or very socially appropriate.

    Recall that by socially appropriate we mean behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "proper" thing to do.
</p>
<p>
    You will win a prize of {{ Constants.prize }} if your rating matches the most common rating Receivers gave to
    an amount of that size taken by a Decider with the screenname Anthony.
